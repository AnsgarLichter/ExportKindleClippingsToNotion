# ExportKindleClippingsToNotion
### Transfer your kindle clippings easily to Notion

### This app is currently still in development.

## Features
The initial version of the application will support the following requirements:

- [ ] The application must be able to import kindle clippings from the kindle clippings file.
- [X] The application must be able to import book covers from the Google Books API.
- [X] The application must be able to export kindle clippings to Notion.
- [X] The application must be able to create new pages for not synchronized books.
- [X] The application must be able to update the pages for already synchronized books.
- [ ] The application must be able to support German and English as languages of the kindle clippings file.
- [ ] The application should recognize the language of the file automatically. If this is not possible, then a parameter or a environment variable should be used.
- [ ] The application should have a clean architecture to support easy enhancements, e. g. support new languages.
- [ ] The application must have an understandable documentation how to setup and use the tool.

## Outlook
Later releases of the app can support more features. Current ideas are:
- [ ] Additional support the amazon homepage as a source for the clippings if there are all information from the clippings file available
- [ ] Support more languages

If you have other ideas or example clippings files for other languages please feel free to open an issue!
